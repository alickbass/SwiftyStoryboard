# SwiftyStoryboard
A More Swifty way to use storyboards

## Motivation:
Take a look at the code below:

```swift
let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
let controller = storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("Settings") as! SettingsViewController
```
Such code has 2 disadvantages:

  * Storyboard name is raw string
  * Controller identifier is raw string
  
We want to get rid of that. `SwiftyStoryboard` allows to deal with both of there problems in one shot. 

## Usage example
We create a struct that conforms to `Storyboard` protocol like this one:

```swift
struct Main: StoryboardType {
    enum ControllerId: String {
        case settings
    }
}
```

and now we can instantiate out controller with specific identifier like this:

```swift
let controller: SettingsViewController = Main.instantiateViewController(with: .settings)
```

Such approach allows us to distinguish different storyboards with different controller identifiers 
and give more information to compiler about our storyboards.


SwiftyStoryboard by deafult take the the type name as the name of the storyboard file. For example, in this case it will take `Main.storyboard` as the name of the type is `Main`
